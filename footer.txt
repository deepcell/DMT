WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE?

This message was automatically transmitted by a system called a Dead
Man's Trigger (DMT). In this context, a DMT is a system designed to
periodically check in with the owner via e-mail. If the owner does not
acknowledge after a pre-determined period of time, it is assumed that
the owner is incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise cannot communicate.

Messages from a DMT may include important information for business
associates, friends, and family of the DMT owner. This may be the only
message you receive from this system, or additional messages may be
forthcoming. You should continue to monitor the e-mail address to
which this message was addressed, including a close check of any spam
or junk mail folders, to ensure all future messages are received.

This system will generally transmit messages at the same time each day.
